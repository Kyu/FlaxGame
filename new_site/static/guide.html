<h1>Gameplay Guide</h1>
<p>Welcome to This Yet to be named game! (Taking suggestions)</p>

<p>You're probably wondering what this is about.</p>

<h2>Goal of the game</h2>

<p>The goal of this game is to capture the entire map for your team.</p>

<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>When you register, you are randomly assigned a team. This team is named after a color.</p>

<p>Your team has a capital, and you are sent back there after you lose too many battles (i.e, you have <10 troops(varies))</p>

<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>The map is defined by locations in decimal like form(1.1, 2.2, 10.10 etc), and you move from location to location and capture each one</p>

<p>To capture a location, you need to sit on it. Every turn, the amount of troops each team has on each hex is calculated</p>

<p>The amount of points each team has is increased by number of team troops - number of enemy troops in the location</p>

<p>Most locations have 1000 capturable points(Capitals have 3000)</p>

<p>You don't need to have all 1000 points to capture the location, all you need is 1. To make it harder for enemies to recap, staying for all 1000 is recommended</p>

<h3>Location Stats</h3>

<p>To fight, you'll need troops and ammo.</p>

<p>You can recruit and gather ammo from each location, though some locations increase population and ammo faster than others.</p>

<p>To increase the increase in population per turn, upgrade the 'Infrastructure' stat of a location</p>

<p>To increase the increase in ammo per turn, upgrade the 'Industry' stat of a location</p>

<p>This costs 5 actions</p>

<h2>Fights</h2>

<p>To reduce the amount of troops an enemy player has(and amount of capturable points), you can attack them.</p>
<p>Fights go like this:</p>

<p>You attack a player, and based on your troop sizes and morale, a winner emerges. No fights are without loss. Attacking costs 1 action,
defending costs none</p>

<h2>Movement</h2>

<p>Some locations are friendly some are not. Friendly locations are those either uncaptured or captured by your team</p>

<p>Movement costs 2 actions between friendlies, 5 actions from Friendly -> Enemy or Enemy -> Friendly, and is impossible from Enemy -> Enemy</p>


<h2>Terminology</h2>
<ol> <!-- TODO do that sub list thingy -->
    <li>Turn: Every 10 minutes, a turn occurs. Actions and morale are increase, and location stats are increased. The hex capturing system kicks in.</li>
    <li>Action: Actions allow you to do well, actions. Moving, attacking, upgrading, and collecting ammo or troops each cost different amounts of actions. The max amount of actions you can have is 10</li>

</ol>
