<h1>Gameplay Guide</h1>
<p>Welcome to This Yet to be named game! (Taking suggestions)</p>

<p>You're probably wondering what this is about.</p>

<h3>Before I explain, here is some terminology.</h3>

<p>Hex, Location: Each of those points on the map (1.1, 1.2, 1.3 etc)</p>

<p>Team: Named after a color. This is used to identify who controls where.</p>

<p>Turn: Every 10(currently at 5 for testing) minutes, a turn happens. In this turn, you get 1 action(max 10),
your morale improves by 1( max 100), and for each hex, the ammo and population grows.</p>

<p>You'll need ammo to fight, and you can recruit 10 people from each hex, once the population is high enough. (This costs 1 action)</p>

<h4>Fights go like this:</h4>

<p>You attack a player, and based on your troop sizes and morale, a winner emerges. No fights are without loss. Attacking costs 1 action,
defending costs none</p>


<h2>How do I win?</h2>

You and your team members try to take control of the entire board, one location at a time.

You can move from location to location by clicking on a neighboring location and clicking "Move here" (This costs 3 actions)

<h4>How do I take control of an hex?</h4>

Hexes have a set amount of points that can be captured, max 1000. At the end of every turn, the team with the most members in a hex gain positive points in that hex, while the others lose points if they had any.
