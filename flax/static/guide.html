<h1>Gameplay Guide</h1>
<p>Welcome to Flax!</p>

<p>You're probably wondering what this is about.</p>
<h6>There's a TL;DR at the very bottom of the page</h6>

<h2>Goal of the game</h2>

<p>The goal of this game is to capture the entire map for your team.</p>

<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>When you register, you are randomly assigned a team. This team is named after a color.</p>

<p>Your team has a capital, and you are sent back there after you lose too many battles (i.e, you have <10 troops(varies))</p>

<h2>Locations</h2>
<p>The map is defined by locations in decimal like form(1.1, 2.2, 10.10 etc), and you move from location to location and capture each one</p>

<p>To capture a location, you need to sit on it. Every turn, the amount of troops each team has on each hex is calculated</p>

<p>The amount of points each team has is increased by number of team troops - number of enemy troops in the location</p>

<p>To collect resources (ammo, troops) from a location, it needs to have been captured by your team.</p>

<p>Most locations have 1000 capturable points(Capitals have 1500)</p>

<p>You don't need to have all 1000 points to capture the location, all you need is 1. To make it harder for enemies to recap, staying for all 1000 is recommended</p>

<h6><b>Note:</b> If an enemy captures your capital you're in big big trouble</h6>
<h3>Location Stats</h3>

<p>To fight, you'll need troops and ammo.</p>

<p>You can recruit and gather ammo from each location, though some locations increase population and ammo faster than others.</p>

<p>To increase the increase in population per turn, upgrade the 'Infrastructure' stat of a location</p>

<p>To increase the increase in ammo per turn, upgrade the 'Industry' stat of a location</p>

<p>This costs 5 actions</p>

<h2>Fights</h2>

<p>To reduce the amount of troops an enemy player has(and amount of capturable points), you can attack them.</p>
<p>Fights go like this:</p>

<p>You attack a player, and based on your troop sizes and morale, a winner emerges. No fights are without loss. Attacking costs 1 action,
defending costs none</p>

<p>Losing a fight costs you morale and troops. If your troops get low enough after an attack, you retreat to your caputal</p>

<p>To increase your defense(not attack), you can also dig in</p>

<h2>Movement</h2>

<p>Some locations are friendly some are not. Friendly locations are those either un captured or captured by your team</p>

<p>Movement is only allowed between neighbouring locations</p>

<p>You can see a vauge description of the type of troops at a location by hovering over it, but you cannot see details such as username and team(unless they're on your team) unless you're in the location</p>

<h2>Action costs</h2>

<h4>Movement</h4>
<p>-> Friendly: 2 actions</p>
<p>Friendly -> Enemy: 5 actions</p>

<p>Enemy -> Enemy: varies</p>

<h4>Attack</h4>
<p>1 action</p>

<h4>Defense</h4>
<p>0 actions</p>

<h4>Infrastructure, Industry Upgrades</h4>
<p>5 actions</p>

<h4>Digging in</h4>
<p>5 actions</p>

<h5>To decrease action costs for movement and upgrading, go to your profile page and upgrade the pathfinder* and development stats</h5>
<p>* Upgrading pathfinder not allowed for tanks</p>


<h2>Squad Types</h2>

<h4>Infantry</h4>
<p>Starts with 50 troops, default max is 100</p>
<p>Cannot do movement Enemy -> Enemy</p>
<p>Can upgrade all stats</p>
<p>Needs 1 ammo per troop member for maximum attack potential</p>

<h4>Tank</h4>
<p>Starts with 5 troops, max is 10</p>
<p>High attack and defense</p>
<p>Can do movement Enemy -> Enemy</p>
<p>Movement costs 2x regular amount</p>
<p>Needs 100 ammo per troop member for max attack potential</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Turn: Every 2 minutes, a turn occurs. Actions and morale are increase, and location stats are increased. The hex capturing system kicks in.</li>
    <li>Action: Actions allow you to do well, actions. Moving, attacking, upgrading, and collecting ammo or troops each cost different amounts of actions. The max amount of actions you can have is 10</li>

</ol>

<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Each x.y cell is a location</li>
    <li>Your team needs to capture all the locations on the map</li>
    <li>If there's an enemy in a location, you can attack them</li>
    <li>You cannot move fron a location captured by an enemy to another location captured by an enemy without capturing one first(Unless 1. You're a tank and 2. You're not in a capital/city)</li>
    <li>A turn is 2 minutes long</li>
    <li>When a turn is complete you get +1 Actions(max 10), +1 morale(max 100), +amount of troops you have capture points to the location you're currently on(max 1000 in plains, 1500 in cities/capitals)</li>
    <li>You can upgrade Industry in a location to increase the production of ammo per turn, Infrastructure to increase the population change</li>
    <li>(Also for optimum success in an attack, an Infantry squad consumes 1 ammo per member, a tank squad consumes 100 per member. Having high morale also helps.</li>
